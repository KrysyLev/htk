The Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK)
-------


The [Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK)](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/)
is a portable toolkit for building and
manipulating hidden Markov models. HTK is primarily used for speech recognition
research although it has been used for numerous other applications including
research into speech synthesis, character recognition and DNA sequencing.
HTK is in use at hundreds of sites worldwide.

The HTK Book for HTK Version 3.5 has DNN-HMM Systems and the chapter 14
dedicated to Artificial Neural Networks.

A DNN-HMM system
A deep neural network (DNN) is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with many hidden layers.
